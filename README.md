# EXPERIMENT 3 PYTHON DATA ANALYSIS (PANDAS) 

### Intended Learning Outcomes
- To identify the codes and functions incorporated in the Pandas library
- To be able to apply and use the different codes and functions in creating a Python program using a Pandas library
- Note: Before starting the Experiment download the corrresponding '.csv' file then save the file in the same folder with your jupyter notebook       

# PROBLEM 1
### a. Load the corresponding .csv file into a data frame named cars using pandas

  1. Download the .csv file named 'cars.csv'
  2. Start the code by accessing Pandas Library "import pandas as pd"
  3. Use the Read function for accessing the .csv file in panda

### b. Displaying the first five and last five rows of the resulting cars.

  1. Using .head() and .tail() code to display both the first 5 rows of the data table and the last 5 rows

### Saving your File as Surname_Pandas-P1.py
  1. Click File
  2. Click Save then Export Notebook As
  3. Select Executable Script


# PROBLEM 2
- We are going to use the Data Frame of Problem 1, to extract the following information using the following practices: subsetting, slicing and indexing operations.


### a. Display the first five rows with odd-numbered columns (columns 1, 3, 5, 7…) of cars
  1. Using slicing and iloc function, select the first 5 odd rows of the cars table to display

## Code and Output of a

### b. Display the row that contains the ‘Model’ of ‘Mazda RX4’
  1. Using the .loc function, Display only the row that contains 'Model' of 'Mazda RX4'

## Code and Ouput of b
